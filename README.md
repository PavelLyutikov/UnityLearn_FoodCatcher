### Functional

____

In this project, it happens in the kitchen, objects fall from the top of the screen, the player can control the basket, he must catch food, and non-edible items should not fall into the basket. When you hit the basket, a counter is triggered that adds or decreases the player's points. Each item has a certain number of points. If the food falls on the floor, the game will be over. The more points the user scores, the objects appear more often and gravity becomes stronger (objects fall faster).
